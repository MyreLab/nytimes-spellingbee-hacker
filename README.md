If you're stuck on the NYTimes spelling bee game, look no further. Enter your letters in the 'letters' string and the program will unscramble them for you, giving you a list of potential words. Here are the conditions:

 1. The first letter of the 'letters' string is the required letter (i.e. the letter that will appear in every word)
 2. Resulting words will use a combination of the provided letters, but not all letters need to be included (except for the first)
 3. Resulting words will not use any letter not specified in the string
 4. Resulting words will be at least 4 characters long
